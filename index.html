        Research shows that making friends is difficult for people with a
        disability. This is an international problem.
      </p>
      <p class="research-page-content">
        People with a disability are among society’s most excluded. They have
        among the highest rates of employment and lowest rates of social
        participation.
      </p>
      <p class="research-page-content">
        We want to change that by removing the social and physical barriers.

        We’ve curated research that explores the problems and solutions for
        connecting people with and without a disability.

        We also do our own research. There are 3 areas we’ve been exploring to
        understand the extent of the problem and what the SociAbility Project
        can work on.
